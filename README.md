# WikiSearch 

This project is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to search for Wikipedia articles relevant to their text input. Users can upload a PDF, type text directly, and select the language for the Wikipedia search (English, Japanese, or French). The application then extracts the main content of the PDF or text input and uses LangChain with OpenAIâ€™s API to fetch relevant Wikipedia articles

## Features

- Upload a PDF file or enter text as input.
- Automatically extract text from PDFs.
- Select the language for Wikipedia searches (English, Japanese, French).
- Fetches up to 3 relevant Wikipedia articles and displays the title and the first 100 words of each.
- Requires an OpenAI API Key for text processing.
